# sia-iot-chatbot
AI-powered chatbot that supports both voice and text-based interactions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide a seamless conversational experience. The chatbot can predict user intents, respond intelligently, and even speak back using generated audio responses.
