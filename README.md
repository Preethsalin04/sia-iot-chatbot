# sia-iot-chatbot
AI-powered chatbot that supports both voice and text-based interactions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide a seamless conversational experience. The chatbot can predict user intents, respond intelligently, and even speak back using generated audio responses.
# AI ChatBot with Voice and Text Interface

An intelligent chatbot with both voice and text interaction capabilities, built using TensorFlow/Keras for natural language processing.

## Features

- 🤖 **Dual Mode Interaction**: Switch between voice and text input
- 🎤 **Speech Recognition**: Built-in voice recognition using Google Speech API
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech**: Voice responses using gTTS
- 🧠 **Neural Network**: LSTM-based intent classification model
- ⚡ **Real-time Processing**: Instant response generation
- 🔄 **Retraining Capability**: Easy model retraining with custom epochs
- 💾 **Model Persistence**: Saves trained model for future use
